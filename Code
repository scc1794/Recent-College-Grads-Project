# Data Visualization: Visualizing Earnings Based On College Major

First we need to import the necessary libraries

A course's job outcomes can be one of the most crucial factors for both course providers and students. Students are usually looking for courses with more job demand and higher salaries. In comparison, institutions may focus on courses based on their market demand and provide future job opportunities as a motivation to attract students. Analysing the job outcomes of previously graduated students provides an overview of the market. I am working with a dataset (recent_grads.cesv) initially released by [American Comunity Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) and cleaned by [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/). The dataset contains the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. I will visualise the distribution and the relation of different variables to answer some question from the dataset.

# [Introduction](#Introduction)


```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
recent_grads = pd.read_csv('recent-grads.csv')
recent_grads.iloc[:1]
```

Based on the first record, we can quickly see Petroleum Engineering is the highest paying major on average.


```python
recent_grads.head()
```

The first 5 records show that engineering majors are dominating the top of the list.


```python
recent_grads.tail()
```

The 5 lowest paying majors are a mix of social science and education

We will drop the rows with missing values.


```python
raw_data_count = len(recent_grads)
print(raw_data_count)
```


```python
recent_grads = recent_grads.dropna()
```


```python
cleaned_data_count = len(recent_grads)
print(cleaned_data_count)
```

In dropping rows with missing values, we only lose one record out of the 173 original rows.

# [Pandas, Scatter Plots](#Pandas, Scatter Plots)

This scatter plot method is made possible by using the Python magic %matplotlib inline 


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='Sample_size', y='Median', kind='scatter', title='Sample vs. Median')
```


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='Sample_size', y='Unemployment_rate', kind='scatter', title='Sample vs UE Rate')
```


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='Full_time', y='Median', kind='scatter', title='Full Time vs Median')
```


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='ShareWomen', y='Unemployment_rate', kind='scatter', title='ShareWomen vs UE Rate')
```


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='Men', y='Median', kind='scatter', title='Men vs Median')
```


```python
recent_grads.plot(x='Women'
                  , y='Median'
                  , kind='scatter'
                  , title='Women vs Median')
```

We can make several observations from the scatter plots above. First we can see that there are a lot of smaller populated majors that make lower median salaries. Second we see that there isn't much of a correlation between popularity of major and unemployment rate. In the full time vs median salary plot we see that there may be a slight negative trend between number of full-time employees and median salary. This is somewhat surprising since more full-time employees suggests better unemployment rates, however the correlation could be caused by higher median salary jobs having smaller number of people in those career fields. In the women vs median salary plot, the majors with lower numbers of women appear to have slightly higher median wages than ones with higher numbers of women. However, I'd say it's a weak relationship based on the plot. We would need to pick a range of number of women to make this graph more readable and easier to interpret.

# [Pandas, Histograms](#Pandas, Histograms)

Use histograms of various bin sizes and ranges to explore column distributions


```python
recent_grads['Sample_size'].hist(bins=10, range=(0,1000))
```

The vast majority of majors have less than 500 students


```python
recent_grads['Median'].hist(bins=10, range=(20000, 80000))
```

The distribution of median salary by major centers between 35000-40000. It is skewed to the right, with the median salary falling below the mean salary.


```python
recent_grads['Employed'].hist(bins=20, range=(1,100000))
```


```python
recent_grads['Full_time'].hist(bins=20, range=(0,100000))
```

The Full Time and Employed columns have similar distributions, with many majors bunching up at the lower end of the x-axis.


```python
recent_grads['ShareWomen'].hist()
```

This is a fascinating graph, showing that there are a large number of majors with majority women and a relatively small amount of majors with minority percent of women


```python
recent_grads['Unemployment_rate'].hist()
```

We can see that most majors have an unemployment rate between 4 and 10%, with the peak between 6 and 8%


```python
recent_grads['Men'].hist(bins=20, range=(0,40000))
```


```python
recent_grads['Women'].hist(bins=20, range=(0,40000))
```

The number of men and women by major histograms are very similar in distribution

# Pandas, Scatter Matrix Plot

We will now create a 2x2 and 3x3 scatter matrix plot to compare 2 and 3 columns at a time, respectively


```python
from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix
```


```python
scatter_matrix(recent_grads[['Sample_size','Median']], figsize=(10,10))
```


```python
scatter_matrix(recent_grads[['Sample_size', 'Median', 'Unemployment_rate']], figsize=(10,10))
```

The first observation I noticed is UE rate has a bell-shaped distribution based on sample size. Additionally, UE rate is fairly consistent across median salaries

# Pandas, Bar Plots


```python
recent_grads[:10].plot.bar(x='Major', y='ShareWomen', legend=False)
recent_grads[163:].plot.bar(x='Major', y='ShareWomen', legend=False)
```

Many of the majors in the first ten rows have low percentages of women, with astronomy and astrophysics being the only major with more than 50% women. The majors in the last ten rows all are greater than 60% women, with early childhood education leading the way very close to 100% women


```python
recent_grads[:10].plot.bar(x='Major', y='Unemployment_rate', legend=False)
recent_grads[163:].plot.bar(x='Major', y='Unemployment_rate', legend=False)
```

Within the first ten majors, nuclear engineering has the largest unemployment rate by far at approximately 18%. In comparison, petroleum engineering comes in just under 2%. In the last ten majors, clinical psychology has the highest unemployment rate at around 15%. Meamwhile early childhood education has the lowest at around 4%. The overall trend seems to be that the last ten records have a higher unemployment rate on average than the first ten, which is interesting when you consider the last ten majors were majority women while the first ten were mostly majority men.

# Next Steps

Use a grouped bar plot to compare number of men with the number of women in each category of majors


```python
df = pd.DataFrame(recent_grads)
```


```python
n = len(pd.unique(df['Major_category']))
print(n)
```


```python
ax = (recent_grads[['Men', 'Women', 'Major_category']]
     .groupby('Major_category')
     .sum()
     .plot.bar())
```

The grouped bar plot above shows there are actually more major categories that are majority women than majority men. The category that has the largest percentage of men over women is engineering, but there are three categories that have similarly large percentages of women over men. The most popular major, business, is pretty evenly split between men and women.


```python
fig, [ax1, ax2] = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(10,10))

ax1.boxplot(recent_grads['Median'], flierprops=dict(marker = 'o'))
ax1.set_ylim(10000, 90000)
ax1.set_title('Median Salary')
ax1.set_axis_bgcolor('silver')

ax2.boxplot(recent_grads['Unemployment_rate'])
ax2.set_title('Unemployment Rate')
```

Both the median salary and unemployment rate boxplots show outliers on the high end of the distribution. The lowest median income is around 22,000 while the highest is near 75,000. For the unemployment rate, the middle 50% of all majors have an unemployment rate between 5% and 9%. The highest unemployment rate is just under 18%.


```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3,2,figsize=(10,15))
plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)

ax1 = recent_grads.plot.hexbin(x='Sample_size'
                         , y='Median'

                         , gridsize=50

                         , ax=axs[1,0]
                         , gridsize=50
                         , rot=45)
ax3.set_ylim(20000, 90000)
ax3.set_xlim(0,200000)
ax3.set_title('Full_time vs Median')

ax4 = recent_grads.plot.hexbin(x='ShareWomen'
                         , y='Unemployment_rate'
                         , ax=axs[1,1]
                         , gridsize=50
                         , rot=45)
ax4.set_title('ShareWomen vs Unemployment_rate')

ax5 = recent_grads.plot.hexbin(x='Men'
                         , y='Median'
                         , ax=axs[2,0]
                         , gridsize=50
                         , rot=45)
ax5.set_ylim(20000, 90000)
ax5.set_xlim(0, 200000)
ax5.set_title('Men vs Median')

ax6 = recent_grads.plot.hexbin(x='Women'
                         , y='Median'
                         , ax=axs[2,1]
                         , gridsize=50
                         , rot=45)
ax6.set_ylim(20000, 90000)
ax6.set_xlim(0, 200000)
ax6.set_title('Women vs Median')
```

# Conclusions:
- Unemployment rate is not strongly correlated to popularity of a major
- As the number of student in a major increases, the more average the median salary is compared to other majors
- The higher paying majors tend to have more men than women
